companies list
- higligh on hover and on click
- on scroll does not change navbar color
- space between the companies and sign up list
- space between the companies footer links

pitch
- highligh on hover and on click
- it is a simple form to submit companies considered global
- by default, approved is set to false
- only companies who has their approval set to true will be displayed

Sign in
- what is the sign in button for? Well, only authorized users can access the 'pending page'
- the pending page is a table with all the companies who are yet to be approved
- there is going to be a button to click them true or false
- the pending page should also display all the companies so that if they need to be edited or deleted, they can be.

Deployment
- deployment is failing on vercel
- add backend environment variables on vercel

Considering
- Is there anyway to indicate that I am currently hovering over the logo?

Bugs
